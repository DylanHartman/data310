  - The model is performing well. It is promising that the validation accuracy is higher than the training accuracy

2.
  - The test accuracy we got was 0.7327499985694885. This does validate our model because it is a decently high score for such a complex task.

  - I read on internet similar problem, but none of the answer could help me. I have a function that for each line of data (data have around 2'000'000 rows) do something and then recall the same function with different parameter depending on what it has done. The issue is that after a while I get this error in the terminal: 'Fatal Python error: Cannot recover from stack overflow.'
  - If I throw a JavaScript exception myself (eg, throw "AArrggg"), how can I get the stack trace (in Firebug or otherwise)? Right now I just get the message.
  - In general, if I have 1000 entries in the dataframe, how can I find out what entry causes a break. Is there anything in ipdb to output the current location (i.e. where the code broke)? Basically, I am trying to pinpoint what value cannot be converted to Int.
  - The model is only somewhat accurate, so it makes sense that only 2 out of the 3 examples were correctly labeled.

  - The major difference between the two models is that the Imbd model is strictly binary while the second model is classifying into 4 categories. The accuracy of the binary model was around 87%, which is significantly higher than the second model. Therefore, it performed better.
